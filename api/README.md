# USE OF API
This project focuses on leveraging Python to access and organize employee data via a REST API. The goal is to export this data into different data structures such as CSV and JSON formats, adhering to the PEP 8 style guide and using appropriate naming conventions for modules, classes, variables, functions, and constants.


## Learning Objectives
- What is an API and how to use it to access data
- What is a REST API and its principles
- Understanding microservices architecture
- The CSV and JSON data formats
- Proper Pythonic naming conventions and coding styles

### Tasks
- `0. Gather data from an API`:
    - Write a Python script that retrieves and displays information about an employee's TODO list progress from a given REST API. The script takes an employee ID as a parameter and formats the output accordingly.
- `1. Export to CSV`:
    - Extend the Python script from Task #0 to export the employee's TODO list data to a CSV file. The CSV file should follow a specified format and naming convention.

- `2. Export to JSON` :
    - Extend the Python script from Task #0 to export the employee's TODO list data to a JSON file. The JSON file should follow a specified format and naming convention.

- `3. Dictionary of list of dictionaries`
    - Extend the Python script from Task #0 to export TODO list data for all employees into a single JSON file. The JSON file should follow a specified format and naming convention.
